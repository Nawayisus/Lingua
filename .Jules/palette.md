## 2026-02-16 - Bootstrap Forms & ARIA
**Learning:** Accessibility compliance in this project requires manually adding `for` attributes to Bootstrap form labels and ensuring progress bars have dynamically updated `aria-valuenow` attributes.
**Action:** Always manually verify and add `for` attributes to labels and ensure dynamic components update their ARIA states in JS, not just their visual styles.
